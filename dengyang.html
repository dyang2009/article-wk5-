        I learned what text-shadow is in my reading assignment, but from this article I learned that text-shadow can be use as a really cool text effect.The effects done by the property depends on the color and background that we choose. Before that it could only be done by rendering image by photoshopping text which came along with some issues. So the best way is to use a css function which will create more space to work with. The browsers that supports text-shadow are Google Chrome 2, Safari since version 1.1, Kongueror since version 3.4, Firefox 3.1/3.5, and Opera 9.5. Internet Explorer has its own programs that they use so it is not yet supported with text-shadow.

    <p>I think that this article is well written and well explanied. I was able to understand the article and easy to follow the tutorial. It is good to know which browsers are supported by text-shadow. That was a really big plus because I wouldn't want to be using an unsupported browser to find out half way that my property isn't working. It's also a nice way that the article also explains what text-shadow is first even before creating the text effects to go along with it. </p>


    <p>I like how the article gave a little history about how making cool text effect was done by photoshopping and rendering images. The text effects are nice to use and be creative with when created on a website. I would definitely play more with the text-shadow to see what I could come up with. </p>
